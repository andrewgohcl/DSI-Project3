Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I've always wondered why pre-gunpowder armies didn't do something similar.

Mathematically, it makes sense - if you have 5,000 soldiers and the enemy has 10,000, why not equip every soldier with a bow and shoot down the enemy army before contact? And if you outnumber the enemy, so much the better - more arrows for fewer targets! I'm thinking primarily of foot archers - I know mass horse archer armies have been common to parts of the world. I'm wondering why Harold's whole army at Hastings didn't fire a few arrows and head home, or why Alexander didn't conquer the world with tens of thousands of fast-firing archers instead of unwieldy phalanxes.

Economically it makes a sort of sense too - surely a weapon which is mainly wood was far cheaper and easier to produce than kitting someone out with a metal sword and a big wood and metal shield? And issuing bows surely does not prevent a soldier from putting the bow away and drawing a close combat weapon anyway - I'm picturing the painted image of the Immortals with their spears in their hands and bows on their backs.

As for why I think armies didn't depend on the bow, I would suggest bows are less effective than I'm giving them credit for. Perhaps the English longbow could whittle down a closing army, but most bows were smaller and weaker, or shields were bigger or armour thicker or horses faster, to make a difference before contact. Perhaps other projectile weapons like the *pilum* served the same purpose without the need for extensive training in two disciplines. And presumably bows and arrows are largely useless anywhere but open battlefields - no using them in cities or forests.

TL;DR - if you have thousands of guys, they could fire tens of thousands of arrows, and that seems like it would deal with most problems.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s that (probably apocryphal) story about a Swiss militiaman who, upon being asked what the 500,000 Swiss soldiers would do if a million Germans invaded, answered &amp;#39;shoot twice and go home&amp;#39;.

* Records of human castration first appear in Lagash during the Ur-III era.

* Also in Sumer, one myth about the creation of humanity mentions that Enki designated individuals who are neither male nor female to serve before the king, which could refer to court eunuchs.

* Hammurabi's legal code demands that any man who commits certain sexual crimes (I wanna say adultery, rape, and maybe sodomy?) be ""made into a eunuch"". Clearly, whether or not eunuchs were an established political presence, the Akkadian language had a word for them.

* As in Babylon, Egyptian law also designated castration as a punishment for some crimes. Perhaps more important to the idea of ""eunuchs"" as a social category, the Carlsberg papyrus mentions a man who was castrated so he could serve in the inner royal chamber.

So does anyone else know more about this?

A central pillar of Decline of British Seapower (Trademarked) style narratives is that the interwar economics and naval treaties caused an irreversible decline in British Shipbuilding, or at least severe enough issues as to cause substantial problems during rearmament and the second world war. There is tons of literature on it.

However it occurs to me that the US industry was beset by exactly the same issues, perhaps worse. The US glut of merchant shipbuilding during the latter half of the first world war is, in part, half the reason the bottom falls out the global shipping/building market. The naval yards must have had much the same issues as British ones with cancellations and reduced orders. So, despite this the US went on to produce more wartime merchant/naval shipping then probably anyone would have thought possible. How did industries survive during the 20s and 30s to the extent they could bounce right back to maximum effort? Or was it new companies? What happened to skilled labour during the period?

And secondly a Literature request - Im falling over history texts on British shipbuilding, economic history, naval procurement,  labour history, impact on regional communities (Clydebank, Tynne etc). Books on big companies like Vickers, Cammell laird, John Brown etc. But i am really struggling to find similar academic work on the economic history of US shipbuilding and shipping industry.

These questions are more about philosophy of history than historiography, so hopefully it's okay to ask here. But I am actually looking for some views on these problems from the side of the historians rather than the philosophers. 

I'm writing my master's dissertation about the history and philosophy of mathematics, more specifically the question of the inevitability of the development of mathematical thought. This is of course a philosophical question, which I won't get into, but it I think it also has an important historical side to it. Which brings me to the fabled historians of my favourite sub!

Firstly, our modern mathematical knowledge is something that has been developed by a cumulative effort throughout millennia by countless different people. Notable figures such as Euclid, Finbonacci or Descartes made great leaps which inspired further work. This might be comparable to Alexander the Great, Mohammed or Napoleon who had a great impact on history and shaped further political and societal developments. 

But I know the great man theory is a debated issue. Do historians still debate on this issue? Is there a consensus amongst working historians? Does this issue affect your work as a historian?

And secondly, from some philosophical perspectives there is only one mathematical reality. All human mathematical systems are based on or are converging towards this idealised mathematical reality. This might mean that even if Euclid did not write his book, given enough time someone would have come up with the same or comparable ideas, because there is only one correct way to think about mathematics. 

Not only is this related to the great man theory, it leads to the question of a certain goal, or at least a rational and understandable path that might be present in history. In the case of mathematics, this might be the development of mathematical thought in concordance with the ideal mathematics. Or in the case of religion it might be the development towards monotheism. Or in the case of politics it might be the development of liberal industrialised nation states. 

These kinds of ideas like determinism, teleology or a discernible path in history seem to me as ideas from previous centuries and not up to date with current historical practise. Is there an ongoing debate on these issues amongst historians? Do these topics even matter to historians working in their own fields or time periods?

I'm not necessarily asking for clear-cut answers but as an amateur historian it occurred to me that these philosophical questions might have some relevance to historians. So I wanted to see if any of the historians on this sub have come across these topics.

Is there an ongoing debate on these issues amongst historians? Do these topics even matter to historians working in their own fields or time periods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not necessarily asking for clear-cut answers but as an amateur historian it occurred to me that these philosophical questions might have some relevance to historians. So I wanted to see if any of the historians on this sub have come across these topics. And how these questions or your own perspective on them affects your work as a historian.&lt;/p&gt;

I know understanding of human sexuality has evolved and become more nuanced and accepting of LGBTQ+ sexuality (as it should), but I'm curious if there was a marked cultural shift in how people understood lesbian sex as actual sex. I also know that there has been a definite erasure/absence/lack of clear LGBTQ+ history, and understand that that likely plays a part here.

I think this is really several questions rolled into one broad topic, but I've been doing some reading on the concept of female friendships in Victorian England, and was just curious as to whether sex between two women was ever considered ""virginal"" (as in, not counting as actual sex) or otherwise socially acceptable. Like, even if they had sex, as long as it was with another woman, was the woman still considered ""pure"" or whatever? 

From what I've read (mostly woman-writer Victorian fiction), I get the sense that it was somewhat okay for women to have sex with each other, as long as they eventually got a husband. I could be completely wrong in my interpretation. 

I'm curious about what this would all mean for how we understand the concept of ""keeping oneself pure before marriage"" and how much of that can be attributed to a more Western/Christian understanding of history (if that makes sense). 


Potentially a tangent, but if it was considered virginal, I think it raises some interesting points about myths of ""virgin"" goddesses, like Artemis or Hestia.

So as title says, I'm designing a grand-strategy board game of operation dynamo. I'm trying to strike a good balance of historical accuracy and streamlined mechanics, but it will be aimed more at those with passion for historical details.

It will use 100's of tiny infantry models ('risk' sized). The game mechanics will bind models together in groups. 1 model a company, 6 models a battalion, 3 battalions a brigade, 3 brigades a division. 
Then some separate artillery + engineer divisional support. (I done some research and I think I have division structure correct. Correct me if I'm wrong)

Allied player(s) will need to evacuate as many troops as possible while several rear guard divisions try to hold bridgehead perimeter as long as possible for port/beach evacuations.

Axis players will need to try and break through perimeter to reach port. Axis players have unlimited stream of reinforcements where as Allied players only reinforcements will come from attempting to recruit scattered companies and broken remains of battalions, scattered between perimeter and port.

So Allied divisions will need to constantly retreat, but slow enough to keep port out of Axis artillery range as long as possible, and quick enough so as to not break under relentless infantry pressure + armoured spearheads.

Id like the game to start about a week before the final evacuation date. With historically accurate army locations.

Can anybody point me toward some maps/articles/books etc, which will provide the following information (at around 5-7 days before port fell):

-locations/maps of which Allied rear-gaurd divisions held specific sectors of the perimiter.

-also the same info on German divisions attacking

-what those divisions where comprised of: What brigades, what battalions, and what strength those battalions where at that date.

-a rough idea of what scattered allied companies/battalions where between perimeter and port.
(I understand it was very disorganized at that point, so perhaps limited info, but rough estimates would be helpful)

-how many men waiting at port/beaches for evacuation on that date.

-breakdown of how many ships available, both civilian and Navy.


From what iv discovered so far, the basic layout (facing inland, back to sea), was the Belgians holding the left flank, French holding right flank, and British holding a wide center. Then With the surrender of the Belgians, Bernard Montgomery's division (on the far left of British center) was able to wheel his division round to fill the gap. 

And apparently did an amazing job of it, under fire the whole time.

But I am sorely lacking the much needed details on numbers here. I would be very greatfull for any info or link to sources to research.

I am really passionate about this and very excited to make it a reality. Thankyou for any info on these matters.

When I meant weaker I meant how did the quality of the army decreased so drastically within just 40 years and if they had truly become weaker. Also even in the previous invasions the Mongols despite beating them in the battles never really conquered or annexed Poland or Hungary. According to the wikipedia in the previous invasions, the Mongols couldn't take the areas with stone fortifications for example in the Siege of Esztergom where they were repulsed at the citadel. Therefore, could the Mongols have conquered the rest of Europe if they struggled to fully annexed Hungary and Poland which had lesser stone fortifications compared to the other parts of Europe?

&amp;#x200B;

Also how true is this statement from wikipedia "" The Mongols had set their sights on the gates of Vienna and raided as far in Wiener Neustadt and Korneuburg.  But then they withdrew from the region. The traditional explanation for  this is that the Mongols received news of the death of Ögedei Khan and  this halted the Mongol advance so that all Mongol leaders in Europe  could return to Mongolia and participate in the kurultai that would  elect a new Khan. But this explanation has been challenged because the  kurultai wasn't actually held until a year later and a new khan wasn't  elected until 1246. Moreover, Batu Khan, who led the European invasion,  refused to return to Mongolia. A more recent explanation is that because  of the existence of a number of stone fortifications, and the  willingness of the populace to flee rather than be enslaved, the Mongols  were only able to devastate Hungary, not subjugate it. Bela never  surrendered or agreed to pay tribute. And Batu's forces suffered  casualties too heavy to sustain. So the Mongols simply withdrew.""

When I meant weaker I meant how did the quality of the army decreased so drastically within just 40 years and if they had truly become weaker. Also even in the previous invasions the Mongols despite beating them in the battles never really conquered or annexed Poland or Hungary. According to the wikipedia in the previous invasions, the Mongols couldn&amp;#39;t take the areas with stone fortifications for example in the Siege of Esztergom where they were repulsed at the citadel. Therefore, could the Mongols have conquered the rest of Europe if they struggled to fully annexed Hungary and Poland which had lesser stone fortifications compared to the other parts of Europe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also how true is this statement from wikipedia &amp;quot; The Mongols had set their sights on the gates of Vienna and raided as far in Wiener Neustadt and Korneuburg.  But then they withdrew from the region. The traditional explanation for  this is that the Mongols received news of the death of Ögedei Khan and  this halted the Mongol advance so that all Mongol leaders in Europe  could return to Mongolia and participate in the kurultai that would  elect a new Khan. But this explanation has been challenged because the  kurultai wasn&amp;#39;t actually held until a year later and a new khan wasn&amp;#39;t  elected until 1246. Moreover, Batu Khan, who led the European invasion,  refused to return to Mongolia. A more recent explanation is that because  of the existence of a number of stone fortifications, and the  willingness of the populace to flee rather than be enslaved, the Mongols  were only able to devastate Hungary, not subjugate it. Bela never  surrendered or agreed to pay tribute. And Batu&amp;#39;s forces suffered  casualties too heavy to sustain.

This, in turn, explains why the Red Army in the early stages of the war struggled against the German Wehrmacht and the Blitzkrieg strategy.

However, listening later about the turnaround of the Eastern Front, such as Kursk and Operation Bagration, it seems that by that stage the Red Army suddenly has better leadership in generals like Zhukov, Rokossovsky, and others who help turn the tide of the war.

Traditionally, scholars have tended to focus on European sources for these topics.

At the same time, the European powers had differing approaches to colonisation. Depending on time and region these could lead to massacres, accommodation, intermarriages or genocide. Lastly, indigenous cultures have remained resilient and vital when faced with these ongoing hardships and discriminations.

/u/611131's research focuses on Spanish conquest and colonization efforts in Mesoamerica during the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. I also can discuss Spanish efforts in Paraguay and Río de la Plata.

/u/anthropology_nerd focuses on the demographic impact of epidemic disease and the Native American slave trade on populations in the Eastern Woodlands and Northern Spanish Borderlands in the first centuries following contact.

/u/aquatermain can answer questions regarding South American colonial history, and more than anything between the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata. Other research interests include early Spanish judicial forms of, and views on control, forced labor and slavery in the Américas; as well as more generally international Relations and geographical-political delimitations of the Spanish and Portuguese empires.

/u/Commodorecoco is an archaeologist who studies how large-scale political events manifest in small-scale material culture. His reserach is based in the 6ht-century Bolivian highlands, but he can also answer questions about colonial and contact-period architecture, art history, and syncretism in the rest of the Andes.

/u/DarthNetflix
examines North American in the long eighteenth century, a time that typically refers to the years between 1688 and 1815. I focus primarily on North American indigenous peoples of this time period, particularly in the southeast and along the Mississippi River corridor. I also study colonial frontiers and borderlands and the peoples who inhabited them, whether they be French, English, or indigenous, so I know quite a bit about French and British colonial societies as a consequence.

 

/u/drylaw is a PhD student working on indigenous scholars of colonial central Mexico. For this AMA he can answer questions on  Spanish colonisation in central Mexico more broadly. Research interests include race relations, indigenous cultures, and the introduction of Iberian law and political organisation overseas.

u/hannahstohelit is a master's student in modern Jewish history who is eager to answer questions about the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition/Expulsion, the subsequent Sefardic diaspora and its effect on colonization of North and South America, and early Jewish communities in the Americas. Due to the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, I will only be available to answer questions on Sunday, but will be glad to return after the holiday is over to catch any that I missed!

/u/Mictlantecuhtli typically works on the Early Formative to Classic period Teuchitlan culture of the Tequila Valleys, Jalisco known for partaking in the West Mexican shaft and chamber tomb tradition and the construction of monumental circular architecture known as guachimontones. However, I have some familiarity with the later Postclassic and early colonial period and could answer questions related to early entradas, Spanish crimes, and the Mixton War of 1540.

/u/onthefailboat is a specialist in maritime history in the western hemisphere, specifically the Caribbean basin. Other specialities include race and slavery, revolution (broadly defined), labor, and empire.


/u/PartyMoses focuses on the Great Lakes region from European contact through to the 19th century, with a specific focus on the early 19th century. I study the impact of European trade on indigenous lifeways, the indigenous impact on European politics, and the middle grounds created in areas of peripheral power between the two.
I'd be happy to answer questions about the Native alliance and its actions during the War of 1812, the political consequences of that conflict, the fur trade, and the settlement or general indigenous history of the Great Lakes region.

u/Snapshot52 is a mod and flaired user of /r/AskHistorians, specializing in Native American Studies and colonialism with a focus on the region of North America. Fields of study include Indigenous perspectives on history, political science, philosophy, and research methodologies. /u/Snapshot52 also mods /r/IndianCountry, the largest sub for Indigenous issues, and is currently a graduate student at George Mason University studying Digital Public Humanities.

/u/Yawarpoma can handle the early colonial history of Venezuela and Colombia. In particular the exploration/conquest periods are my specialty. I’m also able to do early merchant activity in the Caribbean, especially indigenous slavery. I have a background in 16th century Spanish Florida as well.

Over the course of the recent months I stumbled over articles/statements claiming that the British empire acquired a lot of its wealth via exploiting its colonies.

That made me wonder if the overall financial drain and this financial dependance to the US might (or might not) have been a cornerstone for the geostrategical demise of the British empire.

1.1. Was the British Empire exceptionally rich (state funds/private fund) compared to other relevant nations of its time?

1.2. If yes, was the exploitation of its colonies one of the main sources of these riches?

I  am a Czech author who likes to write popularizing articles about historic  events and I am now working on a long-ish article about Operation Badr  in 1973. I am especially intrigued by the defence of the Fort Budapest.

Most  of the sources I found are fairly consistent about the details, but I  keep running into inconsistencies regarding the fate of Avraham Mandler,  the general major who commanded the tank units around the Bar Lev line.  (I know that Mandler was not engaged in defence of Budapest itself, but  he is an outstanding character of the time and place.)

First  of all, not even all authors agree whether his surname was ""Mandler"" or  ""Mendler"", which is a bit confusing. E.g. Chaim Herzog names him  ""Mandler"", but Abraham Rabinovich ""Mendler"". This ambiguity is strange.  How is this possible? I understand that Hebrew language does not always note vowels in written form, but he  was born in Austrian city of Linz. I would guess that his birth certificate would be  in Latin alphabet, so there should be either A or E. Or did he change his name later in life?

Second,  I found varying descriptions of his death. Some claim he was on an  observation post that got hit by an Egyptian missile. Some others that  he was hit by artillery fire when travelling in a half-track. Some say  that the hit was random, but I found a completely different unsourced  claim, too:

""after his voice was  intercepted and identified by Egyptian electronic warfare units using  tactical COMINT equipment, who immediately transmitted his position to  the nearest Second Army artillery battery.  ""

At one point in the article he writes: ""The truth is: Between 1992 and 1995 there were prison camps in the Yugoslavian republic, first and foremost in Bosnia, and in these camps \[prisoners\] were starved, tortured and murdered. But let us cease to mechanically associate these camps with the Bosnian Serbs: There were also Croatian and Muslim \[: Bosniak\] camps ..."" (my translation; original German: ""Wahr ist: Es gab zwischen 1992 und 1995 auf dem Gebiet der jugoslawischen Republiken, vor allem in Bosnien, Gefangenenlager, und es wurde in ihnen gehungert, gefoltert und gemordet. Aber hören wir auf, diese Lager in unseren Köpfen mechanisch mit den Bosno-Serben zu verbinden: Es gab auch kroatische und muslimische Lager ..."")

Later in the article he expands on this: ""And let us – finally – also listen to the survivors of the Muslim massacres, \[which took place\] in many Serbian villages around the – Muslim – Srebenica, massacres which, commanded by the town major, were carried out repeatedly in the three years leading up to the fall of Srebenica, and which – terrible vengeance and an eternal disgrace for the responsible Bosnian Serbs – led to the great slaughter, 'the biggest in Europe since the second World War'"" (my translation; original German: ""Hören wir auch - endlich - den Überlebenden der muslimischen Massaker zu, in den vielen serbischen Dörfern um das - muslimische - Srebrenica, jener in den drei Jahren vor dem Fall Srebrenicas wiederholt begangenen und von dem Stadtkommandanten befehligten Massaker, die im Juli 1995 - schreckliche Rache und ewige Schande für die verantwortlichen Bosno-Serben - zu dem großen Gemetzel führten, 'dem größten in Europa seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg'"").

So, as I understand it, Handke is saying that he does not deny the Srebenica massacre taking place, but he seeks to nuance this by claiming that there were also massacres carried out and prison camps run by Croats and Bosnians during the war.

How accurate – if at all – are these claims made by Handke? Although I have been able to confirm that there were indeed camps during the war run by Croats, I can't seem to be able to find any information regarding the rest of his claims.

* **4** Bundesarchiv/Militärarchiv (BA/MA), N87/61, Otto von Below ""Kriegstagebuch"" (war diary), 15 July1917. All translations are the author's.

So, to my understanding no publishing of the diary in german exists, and the only way to access the document is to contact the [german federal archives](http://www.bundesarchiv.de/EN/Navigation/Home/home.html).

My question to you is: how do I continue from this point on? Can any of you with some experience searching state archives give me some advice? Thank you in advance!

Text below is just to provide a little context:

A friend of mine recently retired from work and is writing a book about the history of those who were drafted during WW1 from his homevillage in the island of Sardinia in Italy, and sent to fight to the Austro-Italian border. Since he is in his 60's and not very accustomed to  digital search, he asked me to help him find the original version of Otto von Below's diary, after he read a book based on the diary :  ""*Caporetto dalla parte del vincitore :il generale Otto von Below e il suo diario inedito*, Mursia, 1992, ISBN 88-425-1156-0"" by  Francesco Fadini. (translation: ""*Caporetto from the side of the winner :general Otto von Below and his unpuplished diary""* ).

I'd imagine artillery fired from an unstable platform, pitching in the ocean, shooting inland at a target it could not see, most likely co-ordinating with a forward observer from a different element, would have incredibly low accuracy.

So, how effective was Naval offshore bombardment during the Second World War?

Going by Angus Maddison, the Roman Empire in the 1st century may have had as much as 1/5th of the population (and 1/3rd of the wealth) located in Italy, while a large majority of the population was living along the Mediterranean. By contrast, Gaul, Germany, the Danube regions and other less accessible places were still fairly sparsely populated.

I was recommended to post this here as I didn’t get many anwers in r/books. 

In George Monbiot's Feral, there is a section in which he describes how many people that integrated in Native American societies never wanted to return to their old way of life even when rescued. Do you happen to know any book (whatever style, although novels are preferred) that describe the life in such societies and what was their approach or phylosophy with their natural surroundings?

I hope this makes sense!

The issue with this I’m having is that, while some weapons are super easy to distinguish (let’s say, a Khopesh for example), a lot more of the terms used for weapons are more... ambiguous. Longsword and shortsword for example are two terms that have been used throughout history to describe a variety of weapons identified in a variety of different ways from what I’ve read. There’s also a lot about weapons being different based on hilt type, handle, etc etc etc.

So I’m just kinda wondering a few things here, and open to general random info bits as well

1. Does anyone here know a good resource I could use anywhere online that is clear and relatively easy to understand on the subject?

2. Any tips, advice and the like that would help in identifying different weapon types?

3. What was the unique purposes behind certain distinctions? What, if anything, makes this weapon or specific weapon part/type better or worse then similar weapons?

4. Since the story I’m writing is open to tons of weapon types, not just swords, what are some unique weapons from throughout history that aren’t relatively well known? I feel like I already have a bunch of ideas for swords, axes, hammers and the like, but I’m curious if there’s anything super unique or rare that could be interesting.

I have been doing reading and have been finding some good debate and so forth, but what is intimidating me is how to actually comment on it, in normal reports I can comment on historiography but I feel like I can&amp;#39;t write a full report on historiography alone.  I understand that Historiography is an important part of History and I will need to be better at this for writing my dissertation.  Any advice on how to tackle Historiography?&lt;/p&gt;

I found that very interesting and wondered if it might be possible to trace the phenomenon of celebrating birthdays in a similar manner. As of what I know of Greco-Roman culture, for instance, birthday celebration was not a thing, I might be wrong though.

This, presumably persian, concept of celebrating your birthday by generously sharing food with friends/relatives/associates etc. is practically how we do it in the western world today. I believe, though this is more of a guess, that the gift giving, at least in the scale in which it takes place today, is a product of modern consumer culture, again I might be mistaken.

My question is, then, is there any evidence for similar customs of celebrating birthdays throughout the globe in the ancient or pre-modern world? I guess it does not have to be similar to the Persian custom; it would be interesting to learn how different cultures have celebrated birthdays throughout time and place.

**Historians on the Battleground of Social Media: Lessons from Eight Years of AskHistorians**

&gt; The twenty-first century public sphere is no longer television interviews and newspaper editorials. We have had to appropriate the word “curate” to describe winnowing one’s exposure to the world into ideologically compatible soundbites that fit onto a phone screen. With each new revelation about Russian hackers’ manipulation of Facebook and alt-right extremists’ infestation of Twitter and Reddit, it grows ever clearer that social media platforms are the new public—the new battleground for control of public discourse. “Public outreach is more important than ever,” we say, eyeing the weaponization of distorted history and the ongoing devaluation of the humanities. But how do we equip historians with the academic and emotional tools to break through “curated” barriers, engaging a general public that has turned “too long; didn’t read” into a commonplace acronym?

&gt; AskHistorians, the Internet’s largest historical public outreach project, has built an audience of 2.5 to 3 million unique visitors each month not despite, but because it provides on-demand historical investigation that is in-depth, comprehensive, and reflects up-to-date scholarship. As its moderators, we have eight years of data regarding successful engagement in social media-based public outreach as professional and alt-ac historians.

&gt; This panel uses quantitative data and qualitative experience from AskHistorians to address the challenges and promises of historical public outreach on social media. The panelists raise issues from the effects of race, gender, and class on scholars’ online experiences and ability to participate; to how the culture of Twitter has shaped ways of thinking about history among the public. They offer strategies for dealing with the patterns of abuse, bigotry, and trolling that historians engaged with a broad social media audience can expect to face; and how to make social media outreach a legitimate way of doing history and a career-enhancing opportunity for history scholars. Above all, they tell a story of what it means and what it takes to represent the entire discipline of history to a world falling further and further into technology adulation and ideological tunnel vision.

&gt; Together, the papers identify the skills necessary for historical professionals to engage successfully with the general public on social media, and to foster the next generation of historians in classrooms with and without walls.

**We would LOVE to see you there:**

&amp;nbsp;

I teach high-school French, and I am trying to choose a book (or even a textbook) about the history of France and/or the French-speaking world.  Since my students are high schoolers, I would love an engaging writing style, especially if the book is longer.  For the same reason, I would lean toward a book in English; if the book is in French, it must not be overly academic in language, as I hope to use it with all levels, including early beginner (French 1).

I am hoping to choose a book that covers Stone Age to Contemporary era history, so that I only have to purchase a set of 1 book, rather than of multiple books.  However, you'll see in my list below that some of my current options do not even fit this criterion, so this is not a deal-breaker in any way.

It would also be a nice bonus if it spends at least some time discussing cultural &amp; historical development of--and perspectives/issues affecting--other parts of the Francophone world, and of minority groups within France throughout history.  Again, this is not a deal-breaker, because I can always find supplemental articles or reading selections to bring in more diverse perspectives.

&amp;nbsp;

These are the options I have found so far, but I do not know how well they fit my criteria:

-- ""A Traveller's History of France"" (Robert Cole)

-- ""La Belle France: A Short History"" (Alistair Horne)

-- ""The Cambridge Illustrated History of France"" (Colin Jones)

-- ""A Concise History of France"" (Roger Price)

-- ""France in the World: A New Global History"" (Patrick Boucheron - originally published in French)*

--""Transnational France: The Modern History of a Universal Nation"" (Tyler Stovall)*

*I am especially intrigued by these two options, based on their descriptions.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice/reviews about any of the books on the above list would be much appreciated!  Or recommendations, separate from my current options!

Even with the Japanese tendency to fight until death and not surrender, I can&amp;#39;t imagine watching my friends all get eaten alive and still refusing to surrender, so I wanted to see what exactly happened at the battle, and see if those numbers were actually accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

Is America seen as Imperialist by birth? Or is it presented as a situation in which America was SEIZED by imperialists. If that's the case, when and by whom is it assumed was America ""taken over"" by capitalists?

**Some backstory**

We recently did a DNA test that showed a very high level of German/Bavarian which had us scratching our heads because we though my grandfather was 100% Czech. This is what prompted me to start researching the Nemec name where I found the information below from Ancestry.com: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Nemec Name Meaning**

Czech and Slovak (Nemec): ethnic name for a German or German-speaker, from nemec ‘German’. In Old Czech this word was used to denote any foreigner, being derived from nemý ‘mute’, referring to an inability to speak Czech. This name is also found in Germany. Slovenian: ethnic name from Nemec ‘German’, a derivative of the adjective nem ‘mute’ (see 1). Germans (mainly Bavarians) were brought in large numbers by feudal overlords to the territory of present-day Slovenia and of the early medieval Slovenian state Carantania (present-day Carinthia and Styria, now divided between Austria and Slovenia).

Specifically I ran across it on [this post from 2008](https://ciphermysteries.com/2008/10/02/british-library-cipher-manuscript). It states that in the Manuscripts section of the British Library, there exists an unusual little book comprised of about 100 pages, handwritten entirely in a unique code, titled ""The Subtelty of Witches - by Ben Ezra Aseph 1657"". Tantalizing, right? A book about witches, from the 17th century, written entirely in a strange code, which apparently no one has ever translated.  

The British Library states that the manuscript was added to their archives in 1836, purchased from a London bookseller named Thomas Rodd (1796-1849), but that's the most anyone knows about its origins. Very little information about the book can be found on the internet. 

I contacted a cryptography expert who had mentioned this manuscript in [a list of encrypted books on his blog](http://scienceblogs.de/klausis-krypto-kolumne/klaus-schmehs-list-of-encrypted-books/). He had a full scan of the book, which he'd made during a recent visit to the British Library. He was kind enough to send me a link to the scan, but asked that I not share it anywhere. 

I have partially decoded the text, but the mods have kindly informed me that I'm not allowed to present original research. All I can say is that the decoded text seems to be mostly copied from a Latin dictionary, with some other words sprinkled in which might be Dutch, Low German, or a related language.

Regardless, the text itself doesn't appear to have anything to do with witchcraft. Perhaps the title page was written by someone who wanted to misrepresent the contents of the book, or perhaps it was intended for a different work entirely. 

The picture that emerges is an author whose native language was Dutch, Low German, or a related language, in the early-mid 17th century (or possibly slightly older), who wanted to practice Latin but had to do so in secret. The author's name given as Ben Ezra Aseph implies Jewish origin, but this name may be unrelated or even an intentional fabrication.

I got as far as decoding the first 15 pages of the book, which you can find in [this Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/147WiPPr). 

If anyone can shed any light on the historical context surrounding the origins of this book, I would be most grateful. Some questions that I'm hoping you folks can help answer:

1- Who actually wrote the book? Or what sort of person is likely to have written it?

2- Why did they need to encode it?

3- Who added the text on the title page, and why? 

4- Did ""Ben Ezra Aseph"" actually exist?

&lt;p&gt;Were any Chinese dynasties ruled by Indo-Europeans or heavily influenced by them, culturally or populations-wise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do the Xiongnu fit in all of this? Are there any historical sources which mention relations between Indo-European nomads and the Xiongnu? Did the Xiongnu develop their horse-based culture through contact with the Indo-European nomads?&lt;/p&gt;

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it.

I have a question. I am Assyrian, and I speak Aramaic. Yet constantly where I live Assyrians are called and labelled (namely by Arab cultures, like the Lebanese for example) Arabs. I tell them that we are not, but still they go on about how we are, and they make fun of us as we have no country (not cool ): )

I’d really like to know in a much more educated sense how and why we are not Arabs. I have said that we (the Assyrians) had our own state, how we were never “arabised”, how we speak the language of Jesus (I bring this fact up because we’re all Christians), and how our empire was one of the strongest empires that had ever existed. Yet they still mock us about how we have no country, how we are fake by not identifying as Arabs when in fact we are Arabs, and so forth.

Could someone explain to me (so that I may explain to them I guess, or maybe so that I understand the topic better, because honestly it doesn’t seem like what I’m doing is working - maybe if I speak in a more educated manner then they’ll understand? or maybe it’s because I’m 16 and they automatically oust me because solely of my age?) how and why Assyrians are NOT Arabs? Thanks so much! Also sorry for the huge task, I know it’s a lot to ask and I’m terrible sorry. It’s just that the constant berating happens on social media and irl too. I understand that it’s mostly jokes (I think, but some people genuinely believe that we’re Arabs) but being called Arabs, being told that we don’t exist because we don’t have a country really really sucks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

I tell them that we are not, but still they go on about how we are, and they make fun of us as we have no country (not cool ): )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d really like to know in a much more educated sense how and why we are not Arabs. I have said that we (the Assyrians) had our own state, how we were never “arabised”, how we speak the language of Jesus (I bring this fact up because we’re all Christians), and how our empire was one of the strongest empires that had ever existed. Yet they still mock us about how we have no country, how we are fake by not identifying as Arabs when in fact we are Arabs, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could someone explain to me (so that I may explain to them I guess, or maybe so that I understand the topic better, because honestly it doesn’t seem like what I’m doing is working - maybe if I speak in a more educated manner then they’ll understand? or maybe it’s because I’m 16 and they automatically oust me because solely of my age?) how and why Assyrians are NOT Arabs? Thanks so much! Also sorry for the huge task, I know it’s a lot to ask and I’m terrible sorry. It’s just that the constant berating happens on social media and irl too. I understand that it’s mostly jokes (I think, but some people genuinely believe that we’re Arabs) but being called Arabs, being told that we don’t exist because we don’t have a country really really sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
